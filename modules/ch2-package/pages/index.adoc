== Introduction

This chapter explores the installation requirements and essential configuration settings of MicroShift, as supported by the Red Hat Build of MicroShift product, with a focus on deployment on air-gaped environments.

The hands-on activities install and configure MicroShift in a RHEL VM, ensure its healthy, and configure it for unprivileged developer access.

IMPORTANT: If you plan to deploy MicroShift as part of a RHEL for Edge system, do *NOT* skip this chapter. You must understand the requirements and configurations introduced here to be able to automate them using Image Builder blueprints. You also need the skills you learn here to perform troubleshooting of your RHEL for Edge images which include MicroShift.
