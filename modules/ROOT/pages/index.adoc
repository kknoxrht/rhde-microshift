= Deploying MicroShift on Red Hat Device Edge
:navtitle: Home

== Objective

This course teaches how to deploy and configure MicroShift on Red Hat Device Edge targets, using either traditional RHEL or RHEL for Edge, to support Kubernetes applications.

It is part of a Red Hat Device Learning path, which currently includes two courses:

* https://redhatquickcourses.github.io/rhde-build/[Building Red Hat Device Edge Images] (prerequisite course)
* *Deploying MicroShift on Red Hat Device Edge Quick Course* (this course)

== Audience

Operations-focused customer roles, who design and implement device edge images, but are not usually in-person at edge sites:

* System Administrations (IT - Information Technology, and OT - Operations Technology)
* Site Reliability Engineers (SREs)
* Platform Engineers
* DevOps Engineers

Red Hat and Partner roles that perform demonstrations, PoC ad PoV of Red Hat Device Edge as part of a sales motion, such as Solutions Architects

Red Hat and Partner roles that support Red Hat Device Edge on customers, such as Services Consultants and Customer Support Engineers.

== Prerequisites

* Attend https://redhatquickcourses.github.io/rhde-build/[RHDE-1: Building Red Hat Device Edge Images] or having equivalent experience with RHEL for Edge.
* Familiarity with RHEL system administration, to the level of RHCA (Red Hat Certified System Administrator) or equivalent knowledge.
* Familiarity with OpenShift administration, to the level of Red Hat Certified OpenShift Administrator or equivalent knowledge.
* Familiarity with Ansible playbooks and Ansible Automation Platform is useful but not required.
* Familiarity with web server administration, such as Apache Web Server or NGinx, is useful but not required.
* Familiarity with database server administration, such as MySQL or MariaDB, is useful but not required.

== Clasroom Environment

The virtual classroom environment is a work in progress and its not yet available to leaners.

If you can provision your own RHEL servers or VMs, it should be possible to configure all that is required for the hands-on activities by using a https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhel/download[free subscriptoion] from the https://developers.redhat.com/about[Red Hat Developer Program], which gives access to RHEL installation media, RHEL package repositories, OpenShift package repositories, and OpenShift container images in Red Hat registries.

== Other Sources of Information About MicroShift

The main source is the https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_build_of_microshift/4.17[product documentation for MicroShift] in Red Hat's documentation portal.

We also recommend that you use the product documentation for https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.17[Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform] for general Kubernetes topics, OpenShift extension APIs, and add-on operators which are supported in MicroShift.

The Red Hat Build of MicroShift is supported as part of Red Hat Device Edge, check its https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_device_edge/4/html/overview/index[overview document] for pointers to MicroShift, RHEL for Edge, and other components of Red Hat Device Edge, in particular the documentation about https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/composing_installing_and_managing_rhel_for_edge_images/index[Composing, installing, and managing RHEL for Edge images].

It is not expected that you need to use the https://microshift.io/[open source upstream] of MicroShift and its community documentation for day to day use of the Red Hat Build of MicroShift.
